# WinSideLoadScript
A simple script to sideload android apps in Windows Subsystem for Android with minimal effort


Please note that for the script to work Windows Subsystem for Android needs to be currently running, this means that you need to have at least one android app currently open or configure Windows Subsystem for Android to always run in the background. Also note that apkx will not install, only use .apk format.


Once you have downloaded and extracted the SideLoadApps folder, you need to download the apk(s) of your choice and open the SideLoadApps folder then put the apk(s) in the AppToInstall folder. You can then run the Install.bat script to start installing the apk(s), you can then check if the apps were succesfully installed by checking the installed apps list as they will appear there.
